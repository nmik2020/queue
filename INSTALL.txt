To be able to build the application you need to have CMake
available on your system.

Invoke CMake as follows:
cmake -g <Makefile format> CMakeLists.txt
make -f Makefile

On Windows you need to use nmake instead of make, in case you
are using Microsoft's tooling.

Afterwards you will have the queue executable ready to be used.
